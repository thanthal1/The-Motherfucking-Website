This is a motherfucking site. And its perfect. Seriously, what else do you want? You probably build sites and think your shit is special. Let me describe your perfect-ass site:

Shit's lightweight and loads fast  
Fits on all your shitty screens  
And gets your 🤬 point across  

You. Are. Over-designing.  
Look at this. It's a site. This is your perfect site. Here's why:  
It's  lightweight  
It works  
It’s 1kb  
Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no idea what a site is.
